# Rules I adhere to when supporting a decentralized / distributed networking messaging platform


 - **No Gamification of the platform.** Allowing people to use resources like Cryptocurrency, Voting or otherwise to make content appear more or less important should be avoided. Groups or resources can be formed by people with ulterior motives to game a piece of content's popularity. Content should be valued by what the message has to offer regardless of a point of view one has about the subject of the message. As an example, but not limited to this one example, some content can be negatively received because of its controversial nature, but in reality if the message can result in improving society, it matters not what people thing about the message.
