# About Scott Larson | AKA: trinsic

I am a writer / researcher for decentralized / distributed networking content platforms. My goal is to bridge the publics understanding and acceptance of these types of content platforms to improve the freedom and privacy of all who speak online in any method they should choose (Video, Audio, Text).

I am studied in Law (Natural/Common), and Technology (PC Hardware/Software Deployments and Functional Analysis/Repair/Resolution).

I am interested in many hobbies on the side. Some of them are: #truth #decentralization #hermetics #healing #naturallaw

You can reach me as of right now on [diaspora](https://diasp.org/). I go by trinsic@diasp.org. You can also find me by my nick name everywhere online as "trinsic".
